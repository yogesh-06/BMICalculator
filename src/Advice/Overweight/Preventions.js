            People should engage in adequate levels of physical activity (60
            minutes a day for children and 150 minutes spread through the week
            for adults). At least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity
            physical activity on most days reduces the risk of obesity and
            co-morbidities

            This is observed that increase in the prevalence of obesity is
            largely due to the obesogenic environment rather than medical and
            genetic problems in the individuals. Therefore prevention of
            overweight and obesity should aim creating environments that
            encourage behaviuoral changes in terms of diet and physical
            activity. <br />
            These efforts must not only focus on the prevention of obesity in
            those who have not yet become obese (primary prevention), but also
            on prevention of further weight gain and promotion of weight loss in
            those who are already obese before they develop the complications of
            obesity (secondary prevention). <br /> Breastfeeding has been
            suggested as a potential protective factor against weight gain in
            childhood and this is important because overweight children and
            adolescents are at risk of becoming overweight adults.
