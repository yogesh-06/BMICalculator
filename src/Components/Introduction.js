              The last one year has taught us how important it is to be healthy.
              The coronavirus pandemic was a rude shock for everyone and it
              reminded everyone that it is extremely important to be healthy.
              People need to follow a well-balanced diet as well as work out. To
              follow a healthy routine, one needs to know their body type. Every
              person has a different body type and hence they cannot be asked to
              follow the same diet or exercise schedule. <br /> Moreover, it is
              not enough to know just your bodyweight; one has to be aware of
              their body mass index (BMI). The online Body Mass Index (BMI)
              calculator is a perfect device to determine that. The BMI
              calculator measures how much body mass you have according to your
              height and weight. Body mass refers not only to the fat within
              your body but also within muscles and bones. It is calculated by
              considering your weight and dividing it by the square of your
              height. This is a useful and easy tool for getting to know
              different weight categories that may lead to health problems.

                  An ideal BMI range which is considered normal is supposedly
                  between 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2. BMI below18.5 (approx) is
                  considered underweight and anything between 24.9 to 30
