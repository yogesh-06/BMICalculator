                  BMI as a single measure may not be the perfect measure of
                  health. However, it is still a useful starting tool which can
                  be used to determine important conditions that can more likely
                  affect a person who is overweight or obese. It is important
                  that a person is aware about their BMI. Many medical
                  professionals also use it as a basis for health checkups.{" "}
                  <br /> <br />
                  Health insurance companies also use it as a measure to
                  determine the premium rates. But more importantly it is an
                  indicator for you to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The
                  Covid-19 pandemic has made us realise how vital it is to be
                  fit and healthy. Hence, knowing your BMI is just a step
                  forward to being aware of your health. <br /> <br />
                  BMI also helps you to take necessary steps to improve your
                  health. If you are overweight, you can take measures to reduce
                  your weight by exercising, following a proper diet etc.
                  Similarly, if you are underweight according to BMI, you can
                  consult your doctor about how to increase your weight
                  following a healthy protocol. Along with BMI, one needs to
                  understand body composition. It describes the amount of fat,
                  bone, water, and muscle in the body. So, to attain a healthy
                  weight range, one has to aware of body mass composition as
                  well.
